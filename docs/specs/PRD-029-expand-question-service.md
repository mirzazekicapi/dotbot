|-------|-------|
| **Issue** | [#29](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/29) |
| **Author** | Dmitry Kuleshov |
| **Date** | 2026-04-19 |
| **Status** | FINAL |
| **Dependencies** | None (builds on existing QuestionService infrastructure) |

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The QuestionService currently supports only **single-choice questions** (with optional free text) delivered to a **flat recipient list** via a **single channel per request**. This limits dotbot's ability to:

- Request **stakeholder sign-off** on generated artifacts (architecture docs, PRDs, diagrams)
- Gather **structured input** beyond option selection (free-text answers, priority rankings, approvals with attached documents)
- **Attach generated artifacts** (rendered markdown, diagrams) to question notifications for review on the server
- Give recipients enough **context in-channel** to triage without opening the web form

These gaps block the vision of dotbot as an autonomous agent that collaborates with human stakeholders through structured, auditable decision workflows.

### Design Principle: Rich Notification + Link-to-Server

Channel messages and the web form split responsibility deliberately:

- **Channels (Teams, Email, Slack, Jira) are the *context surface*.** Every notification carries a rich human-in-the-loop summary: question title + type, a 1-3 line deliverable summary, the list of attachments to review, and any external review links. A reviewer can judge urgency and scope from their inbox/chat, without clicking through.
- **The Mothership web form is the *interaction surface*.** All actual submission - button clicks, comments, drag-and-drop ranking, per-attachment review confirmation - happens here via a magic link. Keeping submission in one place means new question types don't multiply per-channel rendering work.

Channels stay read-only. Interaction lives on the web form.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Artifact approval workflow** - stakeholders can approve/reject generated documents with comments, via any delivery channel (notification -> Mothership web form). Outpost Decisions tab push-back (dual-surface approval, whitepaper section 6.2.1) is out of scope here and tracked in [#416](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/416).
2. **New question types** - approval (approve/reject + comments, with optional attached documents for the reviewer to confirm), free-text input, priority ranking
3. **Attachment support** - generated artifacts (markdown->PDF, diagrams, code diffs) referenced inline with questions across all channels
4. **Rich in-channel summaries** - every notification contains deliverable summary, attachment list, and review links, so a reviewer can triage in place

### Non-Goals

- **Phase 13 (Multi-Channel Q&A) alignment** - out of scope. This PRD is independent; Phase 13 can adopt or extend these models when/if it is started.
- **Role-based question routing** - targeting by role/domain requires the team registry (Phase 14, [#98](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/98)), not yet implemented. Deferred to Phase 14.
- Full questionnaire/batched-question API (`POST /api/questionnaires`)
- New delivery channels beyond the existing four (Teams, Email, Jira, Slack)
- Per-recipient multi-channel fallback (if Teams fails, try email)
- **Governance enforcement** - no quorum rules, no auto-approve policies. Approvals use **first-response-wins** semantics (later responses recorded with agreement/disagreement flags on the instance blob). Quorum belongs to a later governance phase alongside role support.
- **In-channel interactive submission** - no Adaptive Card form posts, no Slack modals. Submission stays on the web form.
- **Eager attachment download on the outpost** - the poller records attachment references only. If a tool needs the bytes, it fetches via `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}` on demand.
- **Attachment cleanup / orphan sweep** - not implemented in v1. Orphans from failed uploads, superseded templates, or deleted questions remain in storage; manual cleanup if ever needed. On known client-side upload failures the outpost calls `DELETE /api/attachments/{storageRef}` for already-uploaded files in the same publish, so successful-partial-then-failed publishes don't leak. Crash-mid-publish is accepted debt.
- **Interview clarification pipelines** - out of scope for producing or consuming the new question types. Two parallel question/answer flows live outside the task-level `needs-input` machinery this PRD covers and are not touched here:
  1. `Invoke-InterviewLoop` in `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Task/Dotbot.Task.psm1` runs inside the interview executor plugin. It publishes `clarification-questions.json` and reads answers from `clarification-answers.{ProcessId}.json` in `product_dir`, producing `interview-summary.md` as its deliverable. Clarification questions are open-ended by design (singleChoice / freeText only); approval and priorityRanking semantics do not apply.
  2. `Invoke-TaskClarificationLoopIfPresent` in `src/runtime/Scripts/Invoke-WorkflowProcess.ps1` runs as a post-task hook on every workflow task. It picks up a `clarification-questions.json` the task agent may have written during its work, collects answers via file-watch only, appends them to `interview-summary.md` under a `## Clarification Log` table, and runs `recipes/includes/adjust-after-answers.md` as a separate Claude session to rewrite affected artifacts. The Teams notification path for this hook is documented in its source as "tracked as follow-up work" and is not implemented in v4.

  The shared `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` parser is type-agnostic so threading new typed fields through it does not break the interview loop, but both interview pipelines read only `answer` + `attachments` from the resolved hashtable and drop the other typed fields on purpose. Bringing either pipeline into the typed-question model is a future change tracked separately.

## 3. Current State

### 3.1 What Exists

| Component | State | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `QuestionTemplate` | Single type | `Type = "singleChoice"`, options with pros/cons, `ResponseSettings` for multi-select and free text |
| `QuestionInstance` | Flat recipients | `SentTo: List<InstanceRecipient>` with email/AadObjectId/SlackUserId, single channel |
| `ResponseRecordV2` | Option + text | `SelectedOptionId`, `FreeText`, `Attachments` (response-side only) |
| `CreateInstanceRequest` | Single channel | One `Channel` field, flat `Recipients` |
| Delivery providers | 4 channels | Teams (Adaptive Cards), Email (HTML), Jira (wiki tables), Slack (Block Kit) |
| `DeliveryOrchestrator` | Basic routing | Channel validation, business hours, magic links, reminders/escalation |
| Outpost MCP | Task-level question groups | `task_set_status` moves the task to `needs-input` and `task_update` writes `pending_question` / `pending_questions[]` onto the task. The runtime `Send-TaskNotification` publishes each question as its own template + instance. `NotificationPoller.psm1` polls Mothership for responses and dispatches each via `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` + `Resolve-TaskInputAnswer` to update the task. |

### 3.2 What's Missing

- No `Type` enum - the `"singleChoice"` string is the only known value
- No attachment support on `QuestionTemplate` (only on `ResponseRecordV2`)
- No approval-specific response model (approve/reject + comments, with optional per-attachment confirmations)
- No review link model to reference external artifacts for in-context review
- **No shared notification-summary model** - each provider hand-rolls its own message, so adding a field (e.g. attachment list) today means editing four files with drift between them

---

## 4. Proposed Design

### 4.1 Question Type System

Introduce a string-constant taxonomy for `Type` on `QuestionTemplate` (validated at the API boundary - see the `QuestionTypes` class below):

| Type | Behavior | Options | Response Model |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|
| `singleChoice` | Select one option from a list (current behavior) | Required, 2+ options | `SelectedOptionId` + optional `FreeText` |
| `approval` | Approve/reject with mandatory comment on reject. Optional `attachments` make the reviewer confirm each attached document before submitting. | None (Approve/Reject buttons are rendered by the form) | `Answer` (`"approved"` \| `"rejected"`) + `Comment` (required on reject) + `ReviewedAttachmentIds` (when attachments present) |
| `freeText` | Open-ended text response | None (no options) | `FreeText` (required) |
| `priorityRanking` | Rank items by ordinal priority (no weights) | Required, 2+ items to rank | `RankedItems[]` (ordered list of option IDs) |

**Server model changes:**

```csharp
// QuestionTemplate.cs - extend
public class QuestionTemplate
{
    // ... existing fields ...
    public string Type { get; set; } = "singleChoice";  // validated against QuestionTypes.AllowedTypes
    public List<Attachment>? Attachments { get; set; }   // NEW
    public List<ReviewLink>? ReviewLinks { get; set; }   // NEW
    public string? DeliverableSummary { get; set; }      // NEW - 1-3 line summary for notifications
}
```

The `Options` field remains required for `singleChoice` and `priorityRanking`, is empty for `approval` and `freeText` (the form renders Approve/Reject buttons directly for `approval`).

A static `QuestionTypes` class (`Models/QuestionTypes.cs`) holds the five string constants (`QuestionTypes.SingleChoice`, `QuestionTypes.Approval`, etc.) plus `AllowedTypes` for validation. The server validates `QuestionTemplate.Type` against `AllowedTypes` at `POST /api/templates` and rejects typos with `400 Bad Request`.

`DeliverableSummary` is the author-supplied 1-3 sentence explanation of *what needs review*. It is rendered prominently in every channel notification. **Required** for `approval` templates that carry attachments (validated at `POST /api/templates`; rejected with `400 Bad Request` if missing or blank); **optional** for plain `approval`, `singleChoice`, `freeText`, and `priorityRanking` where the title + options carry enough context on their own. (Note: the rule is currently parked in the validator pending outpost support for emitting the summary; see the TODO on `CheckDeliverableSummary`.)

`priorityRanking` uses **ordinal ranks only** (1 = highest priority, 2 = next, ...). No weighted scores in this release - a future enhancement could add an optional `Weight: double?` on `RankedItem` non-breakingly.

### 4.2 Attachment & Review Link Models

```csharp
// Models/Attachment.cs - NEW
public class Attachment
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }          // "architecture-v2.pdf"
    public required string ContentType { get; set; }   // "application/pdf"
    public required string StorageRef { get; set; }    // blob reference from upload
    public long? SizeBytes { get; set; }
    public string? Description { get; set; }
}

// Models/ReviewLink.cs - NEW
public class ReviewLink
{
    public required string Title { get; set; }         // "PR #42 - Schema changes"
    public required string Url { get; set; }           // external URL
    public string? Type { get; set; }                  // "pull-request"|"document"|"design"|"other"
    public string? Description { get; set; }
    public bool RequiresReview { get; set; }           // must confirm reviewed before responding
}
```

**Storage abstraction.** A single `IAttachmentStorage` interface with two implementations from day one:

- **Azure Blob** - cloud deployments
- **Local filesystem** - self-hosted deployments

Selected via config. Interface surface: `UploadAsync`, `DownloadAsync`, `DeleteAsync`. `DownloadAsync` returns a stream; the Mothership proxies file content through `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}`. Both backends present the same contract - clients never talk to Azure Blob or the filesystem directly. If bandwidth later becomes a concern for the Azure Blob case, `GetSignedUrlAsync` can be added non-breakingly and direct-to-storage downloads enabled per-backend.

**Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/attachments
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
-> { attachmentId, storageRef, name, contentType, sizeBytes }

GET  /api/attachments/{storageRef}?token={jwt}
-> binary stream. Authorized by the same magic-link JWT that gates /respond.
-> Middleware checks: JWT signature, JTI not consumed, storageRef owned by JWT's instanceId.
-> Called by the web form only - channels do not carry download links.
```

**`storageRef` format and validation.** `storageRef` is **server-issued only** - clients never construct one. Format: `{instanceId-guid}/{sanitized-filename}` where sanitized-filename matches `[A-Za-z0-9._-]+`. `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}` validates the pattern on entry and rejects anything containing `..`, `/..`, `\`, null bytes, or absolute paths with `400 Bad Request`.

**Size limits** (both configurable):

- `BlobStorage:MaxAttachmentSizeMb` - per-file cap, default **15 MB** (aligned with existing `Respond.cshtml`)
- `BlobStorage:MaxTotalAttachmentsPerQuestionMb` - per-question total cap, default **50 MB**

Channels show attachment **names and sizes only** as metadata - so the recipient knows what the review will contain. **No download URLs in the channel message.** All downloads happen on the Mothership web form (reached via the magic link), authorized by the same magic-link JWT. `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}?token={jwt}` requires the JWT's `instanceId` to own the requested `storageRef`.

**Attachment download authorization.** `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}` is covered by the same `MagicLinkAuthMiddleware` that gates `/respond`. The web form renders each download link as `/api/attachments/{storageRef}?token={jwt}`, reusing the magic-link JWT already present in the `/respond` URL. The middleware validates the JWT, verifies the JWT's `instanceId` owns the requested `storageRef`, and streams the file. No separate cookie or session mechanism is introduced. The existing **device cookie** (30-day lifetime, set at form POST time for recipient-email recognition across magic-link reissues) is unchanged and unrelated to attachment downloads.

### 4.3 Response Model Extension

Extend `ResponseRecordV2` to capture type-specific response data:

```csharp
public class ResponseRecordV2
{
    // ... existing fields (SelectedOptionId, FreeText, etc.) ...

    // NEW - approval responses (merged with the former documentReview type)
    // Decision values for QuestionTemplate.Type == "approval":
    //   "approved" | "rejected"
    public string? ApprovalDecision { get; set; }
    public string? Comment { get; set; }                // required on reject
    public List<Guid>? ReviewedAttachmentIds { get; set; }  // populated when the
                                                            // approval template
                                                            // carries attachments
    public List<RankedItem>? RankedItems { get; set; }  // for priorityRanking
}

public class RankedItem
{
    public required Guid OptionId { get; set; }
    public required int Rank { get; set; }              // 1 = highest priority (ordinal only)
}
```

Backwards-compatible: existing `singleChoice` responses continue using `SelectedOptionId` + `FreeText`.

### 4.4 Approval Flow

For `approval` question instances (with or without attachments):

1. Outpost publishes template with `Type = "approval"` + attachments
2. Mothership creates instance and delivers notifications to channels
3. Respondent reads context from the rich notification, clicks the magic link, opens the question page, submits the response on the Mothership web form
4. **First response (by timestamp) is authoritative.** No quorum, no override - this is the governance posture for v1. (One response per question in P0 scope. See P2 forward-pointer below for dual-surface conflict handling.)
5. Outpost reconciles the response on the next poll tick

**Outpost Decisions tab push-back (dual-surface approval, whitepaper section 6.2.1) is out of scope for this PRD.** Today the Outpost Decisions tab approves an `approval`-typed question via the same path as any other pending question - no special-case handling, no push-back to Mothership. The proper dual-surface flow (local approval pushed to Mothership via `POST /api/responses`, first-by-timestamp resolution, agreement/disagreement flagging) is tracked separately in [#416](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/416).

### 4.5 Channel Delivery Model: Rich Notification + Link

**All channels render a shared `NotificationSummary`** - a single in-memory shape built **once per instance** by `DeliveryOrchestrator`. Only the magic-link URL (`RespondUrl`) is personalized per recipient before the summary is handed to the provider. Providers own only the *rendering* (Adaptive Card / HTML / Block Kit / wiki-format comment); they no longer compose message bodies from raw template fields.

```csharp
// Services/Delivery/NotificationSummary.cs
public class NotificationSummary
{
    public required string QuestionTitle { get; set; }       // "Approve architecture v2"
    public required string QuestionType { get; set; }        // used for badge
    public required string ProjectName { get; set; }

    public string? DeliverableSummary { get; set; }          // 1-3 line "what needs review"
    public string? Context { get; set; }                     // longer context from template

    public List<AttachmentRef> Attachments { get; set; } = new();
    public List<ReviewLinkRef> ReviewLinks { get; set; } = new();

    public required string RespondUrl { get; set; }          // magic link to web form
    public DateTime? DueBy { get; set; }
    public bool IsReminder { get; set; }
}

public class AttachmentRef
{
    public required string Name { get; set; }
    public required string ContentType { get; set; }
    public long? SizeBytes { get; set; }
    // No DownloadUrl - channels do not link to files. Downloads happen on the web form
    // after the magic link is followed. See sec. 4.2.
}

public class ReviewLinkRef
{
    public required string Title { get; set; }
    public required string Url { get; set; }
    public string? Type { get; set; }
}
```

**Every channel displays, in its own native format:**

1. **Header** - question title + type badge + project name + reminder marker
2. **Deliverable summary** (prominent)
3. **Context** - optional longer block
4. **Attachments** - name + size only (download happens on the web form after Respond Now)
5. **Review links** - title + URL (+ "requires review" marker if set; external URLs are safe to link directly)
6. **Respond Now** - the only action that leaves the channel; points at the web form

**Per-channel rendering notes:**

| Channel | Format | Rendering notes |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Email | HTML (existing CRT theme) | Full sections, attachment list as a plain table (name + size, no links), single CTA button -> Respond Now |
| Teams | Adaptive Card | TextBlocks for header/summary/context, attachment list as TextBlocks (name + size), single Action.OpenUrl -> Respond Now |
| Slack | Block Kit | `section` blocks for summary; attachment list as mrkdwn bullets (name + size); `actions` block with a single Respond Now button |
| Jira | Issue comment | Wiki-format: `h3.` header, paragraph summary, `*` bulleted lists, magic link URL inline as the only clickable element |

**The Mothership web form (`Respond.cshtml`) remains the single rich interaction surface.** It handles all question types with full interactivity. Each question is delivered as its own `QuestionInstance` with its own magic link; the form renders the type-specific input.

| Type | Web Form Rendering |
|------|--------------------|
| `singleChoice` | Radio buttons + optional free text (current behavior) |
| `approval` | Approve/Reject buttons + comment textarea (required on reject). When the template carries `attachments`, the form also renders a confirmation checkbox per item (recorded in `ReviewedAttachmentIds`) above the decision buttons. |
| `freeText` | Multiline textarea (required) |
| `priorityRanking` | Drag-and-drop sortable list |

**Benefits of this split (rich channel / interactive web form):**
- **Zero per-channel work** for new question types - add the type to the web form only; every channel already displays the summary
- **Consistent UX** - respondents always see the same form regardless of channel
- **Simpler provider code** - each provider renders one shape; no conditional logic per question type
- **Future-proof** - adding a new channel (Discord, WhatsApp, web) means implementing one renderer

### 4.6 Outpost-Side Changes

v4 has no dedicated MCP tool for question publishing or answering. Questions move through the generic `task_set_status` transition (with `status: needs-input`) plus a `task_update` that writes `pending_question` (single) or `pending_questions[]` (batch) onto the task. Notification dispatch and response parsing live in runtime modules.

**Pending question carrier (on the task JSON, under `extensions.runner.pending_question` or `pending_questions[]`):**

```json
{
  "id": "q_xxxxxxxx",
  "question": "...",
  "context": "...",
  "options": [ { "key": "A", "label": "...", "rationale": "..." } ],
  "recommendation": "A",
  "type": "singleChoice | approval | freeText | priorityRanking",
  "deliverable_summary": "1-3 line summary of what needs review",
  "attachments": [
    { "path": "workspace/attachments/.../file.pdf", "description": "..." }
  ],
  "review_links": [
    { "title": "PR #42", "url": "https://...", "type": "pull-request" }
  ]
}
```

The `type`, `deliverable_summary`, `attachments`, `review_links` fields are the new additions; existing tasks without them continue to behave as `singleChoice`.

**Runtime: `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Notification/Dotbot.Notification.psm1`** - extend `Send-TaskNotification` and `Invoke-AttachmentBatchUpload` to:
1. Upload attachments via `POST /api/attachments` before creating the template
2. Include `type`, `deliverableSummary`, `attachments`, `referenceLinks` on the template payload
3. Map outpost-side keys (`title`, `url`, `type`) to server-side wire shape (`label`, `url`) for `referenceLinks`

**Runtime: `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.TaskInput/Dotbot.TaskInput.psm1`** - extend `Resolve-TaskInputAnswer`:
- For `approval` questions, accept the response payload's `answer` value (`approved` / `rejected`)
- Carry `comment` from the response into the resolved entry (required when `answer = rejected` on `approval`)
- For `priorityRanking`, carry `ranked_items` through to the resolved entry

**UI: `src/ui/modules/NotificationPoller.psm1`** - extend `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` to read `approvalDecision`, `comment`, `rankedItems`, and `reviewedAttachmentIds` from the Mothership response and map them to the runtime answer-resolver inputs above.

> **Not touched here:** `Invoke-InterviewLoop` in `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Task/Dotbot.Task.psm1` runs its own parallel question/answer pipeline for interview clarification questions (file-based, ephemeral, not persisted to `questions_resolved`). It calls the same `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` parser but uses only `answer` + `attachments` from the result and drops the rest on purpose. Clarification questions are open-ended by design; approval / priorityRanking semantics do not apply. Threading these question types into the interview pipeline is a future change - see the Non-Goals list in Section 2.

## 5. Communication Flow

The Outpost-Mothership integration uses **pull-based polling** - no persistent connection, no webhooks, no push. The Outpost polls every 30 seconds for responses.

### 5.1 Current Integration Architecture

```

  POST /api/attachments                 Upload file to blob store (NEW)
  POST /api/responses                   Push local approval (out of scope - see #416)

  ---- Pull (Outpost <- Mothership) ----
  GET  /api/instances/{p}/{q}/{i}/responses   Return ResponseRecordV2[]

   (default 30 days if EscalateAfterDays is null)
   -> after expiry, /respond?token=X returns 410 Gone;
     abandoned links expire predictably.
```

### 5.4 Response Polling (Outpost <- Mothership)

```
 OUTPOST                                           MOTHERSHIP
 ------                                            ----------

 NotificationPoller.psm1
   (background runspace, every 30s)
   |
   | For each task with notification metadata:
   |
   +-- GET /api/instances/{p}/{q}/{i}/responses ---> ResponseStorageService
   |                                                  list blobs matching pattern
   |   <--- ResponseRecordV2[] (sorted by time) <---   return all responses
   |
   | If response found:
   |   |
   |   |   (attachment references recorded in task JSON;
   |   |    bytes fetched on demand, not during poll)
   |   |
   |   +-- Single question:      -> move task needs-input -> analysing
   |   +-- Task with pending_questions[] (task-level batch):
   |   |                          -> mark answered per question; move when all done
   |   +-- Split proposal:       -> delegate to task-approve-split or mark rejected
   |
   v
 Task JSON updated:
   questions_resolved: [{
     id, question, answer, answer_type,
     comment,                    <- NEW (approval only)
     attachment_refs,            <- NEW (refs only, not bytes)
     asked_at, answered_at,
     answered_via: "notification"
   }]

 For approval-typed answers, the decision ("approved" / "rejected") is
 carried in the `answer` field — there is no separate
 approval_decision field on persisted entries.
```

### 5.5 Dual-Surface Approval Sync (out of scope)

Out of scope for this PRD. Tracked in [#416](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/416): Outpost Decisions tab push-back via `POST /api/responses`, first-by-timestamp resolution, agreement/disagreement flagging, and the `ResponseId` upsert/idempotency contract all live there.

### 5.6 Reminder & Escalation (Server-Side Background)

Mostly unchanged from current behavior. `ReminderEscalationService` scans active instances and triggers `DeliveryOrchestrator.DeliverReminderAsync()` at `ReminderAfterHours`; status transitions "sent" -> "reminded" -> "escalated" at `EscalateAfterDays`.

**Null-field handling:** If `ReminderAfterHours` is null, no reminder fires. If `EscalateAfterDays` is null, no escalation transition happens (status stays "reminded"). This is distinct from the JTI-expiry default in sec.5.3, which *does* fall back to 30 days when `EscalateAfterDays` is null - because the JTI must have a hard lifetime even when escalation is disabled.

**Suppression rule:** before delivering a reminder, the service queries `ResponseStorageService` for existing responses on the instance. If a response exists, the reminder is **suppressed** (the instance is effectively complete and the outpost poller will reconcile on its next tick).

## 6. Files to Create/Modify

### Server-side (Mothership)

| Action | Path | Change |
|--------|------|--------|
| Create | `Models/Attachment.cs` | Attachment record with name, content type, storage ref |
| Create | `Models/ReviewLink.cs` | Review link with title, URL, type, requires-review flag |
| Create | `Models/RankedItem.cs` | Priority ranking response item (ordinal Rank) |
| Create | `Models/QuestionTypes.cs` | String constants for question types + `AllowedTypes` validation array |
| Create | `Services/IAttachmentStorage.cs` | Storage abstraction: Upload / Download (stream) / Delete |
| Create | `Services/AzureBlobAttachmentStorage.cs` | Azure Blob implementation |
| Create | `Services/LocalFileAttachmentStorage.cs` | Local filesystem implementation |
| Create | `Services/Delivery/NotificationSummary.cs` | Shared summary DTO (see sec.4.5) |
| Create | `Services/Delivery/NotificationSummaryBuilder.cs` | Builds the shared `NotificationSummary` from template + project context |
| Modify | `Models/QuestionTemplate.cs` | Add `Attachments`, `ReviewLinks`, `DeliverableSummary` |
| Modify | `Models/ResponseRecordV2.cs` | Add `ApprovalDecision`, `Comment`, `ReviewedAttachmentIds`, `RankedItems` |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/IQuestionDeliveryProvider.cs` | `DeliveryContext` carries `NotificationSummary` |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/DeliveryOrchestrator.cs` | Build summary **once per instance** via `NotificationSummaryBuilder`; personalize `RespondUrl` per recipient; hand to provider |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/TeamsDeliveryProvider.cs` | Adaptive Card renders full `NotificationSummary` |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/EmailDeliveryProvider.cs` | HTML email renders full `NotificationSummary` |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/SlackDeliveryProvider.cs` | Block Kit renders full `NotificationSummary` |
| Modify | `Services/Delivery/JiraDeliveryProvider.cs` | Wiki comment renders full `NotificationSummary` |
| Modify | `Pages/Respond.cshtml` | Full question-type handling: approval form (with optional attachment-review checklist), ranking drag-and-drop, free text |
| Create | API endpoint: `POST /api/attachments` | Multipart upload -> `IAttachmentStorage` |
| Create | API endpoint: `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}` | Stream blob content; middleware validates `?token={jwt}` and verifies JWT's `instanceId` owns the `storageRef` |

### Outpost-side (Client)

v4 routes question publishing and answering through runtime modules + generic MCP tools (`task_set_status`, `task_update`); the v3-era `task-mark-needs-input` and `task-answer-question` tools are gone.

| Action | Path | Change |
|--------|------|--------|
| Modify | `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Task/Dotbot.Task.psm1` | Propagate the new pending-question fields (`type`, `deliverable_summary`, `attachments`, `review_links`) into the `Send-TaskNotification` call |
| Modify | `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Notification/Dotbot.Notification.psm1` | `Send-TaskNotification` accepts `Type`, `DeliverableSummary`, `Attachments`, `ReviewLinks` and emits them on the template payload (already present in v4 - any drift fixed here); `Invoke-AttachmentBatchUpload` uploads attachments before publish |
| Modify | `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.TaskInput/Dotbot.TaskInput.psm1` | `Resolve-TaskInputAnswer` accepts approval `answer` (`approved`/`rejected`) + `comment`; `priorityRanking` accepts `ranked_items` |
| Modify | `src/ui/modules/NotificationPoller.psm1` | `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` reads `approvalDecision`, `comment`, `rankedItems`, `reviewedAttachmentIds` from the Mothership response (refs only, no file download) and maps them to the runtime answer-resolver |

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### P0 - Must Have

- [ ] `QuestionTemplate.Type` supports values: `singleChoice`, `approval`, `freeText`, `priorityRanking`
- [ ] `QuestionTemplate` accepts optional `Attachments` and `ReviewLinks`; `DeliverableSummary` is **required** for `approval` templates that carry attachments (validated at `POST /api/templates`), optional for other types (see sec.4.1)
- [ ] `NotificationSummary` DTO + `NotificationSummaryBuilder` exist and are used by all four providers
- [ ] All 4 channels (Teams, Email, Slack, Jira) render notifications containing: question title + type badge, deliverable summary, attachment list, review-link list, magic link to web form
- [ ] Mothership web form (`Respond.cshtml`) supports all question types with full interactivity
- [ ] `IAttachmentStorage` abstraction with **both** `AzureBlobAttachmentStorage` and `LocalFileAttachmentStorage` implementations; backend selectable via config
- [ ] `POST /api/attachments` + `GET /api/attachments/{storageRef}` functional; per-file limit 15 MB, per-question total limit 50 MB (both configurable)
- [ ] `ResponseRecordV2` captures `ApprovalDecision`, `Comment` for approval/review responses
- [ ] Pending-question carrier on the task JSON accepts `type`, `deliverable_summary`, `attachments`, `review_links`; `Send-TaskNotification` in `src/runtime/Modules/Dotbot.Notification` emits them on the template payload to Mothership
- [ ] `Resolve-NotificationAnswer` (UI poller) + `Resolve-TaskInputAnswer` (runtime) accept `approvalDecision` / `answer` (`approved` / `rejected`) + `comment` for approval responses, and persist them into the task's `questions_resolved` entry
- [ ] Outpost poller records attachment references only (no eager download)
- [ ] Approval uses first-response-wins semantics (no quorum)
- [ ] Reject on `approval` type requires a non-empty `Comment` - validated on server + web form
- [ ] `MagicLinkAuthMiddleware` covers `/respond*` AND `GET /api/attachments/*`; verifies the JWT's `questionInstanceId` owns the requested `storageRef`; returns 410 Gone (not 401) when the JWT or JTI blob is expired
- [ ] Magic-link JTI lifetime sourced from `Template.DeliveryDefaults.EscalateAfterDays` with a 30-day fallback when null
- [ ] Reminder suppression: if a response exists for the instance, the reminder is not delivered
- [ ] Existing `singleChoice` behavior fully backwards-compatible

### P1 - Should Have

- [ ] `approval` questions with attachments render the per-attachment confirmation checklist above the Approve / Reject decision buttons in the web form
- [ ] `priorityRanking` type with drag-and-drop ranking in web form (ordinal only)

### P2 - Nice to Have

- [ ] Dual-surface approval sync (Outpost Decisions tab push-back, first-by-timestamp resolution, agreement/disagreement flagging) - tracked in [#416](https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot/issues/416)
- [ ] `ReviewLink.RequiresReview` enforcement (must confirm reviewed before submitting response)
- [ ] Attachment inline preview in web form (PDF viewer, image preview, markdown render)

### Polish (deferred - decide during implementation, not blocking plan)

- [ ] **Content-type filter on upload** (`POST /api/attachments`) - minimal blacklist of executable extensions (`.exe`, `.msi`, `.dll`, `.bat`, `.sh`, `.ps1`, `.cmd`, `.scr`, `.vbs`). Attachments in practice come from Claude-generated output, so risk is low.
- [ ] **`NotificationSummary.DueBy` derivation** - default rule `Instance.SentAt + Template.DeliveryDefaults.EscalateAfterDays` (null if `EscalateAfterDays` not set); rendered as "Due by: {date}" in header.
- [ ] **Reminder rendering convention** - `IsReminder=true` surfaces in each channel: email subject prefixed `"Reminder: "`; Teams/Slack/Jira show ` REMINDER` marker + *"Originally sent: {timestamp}"* line in header.
- [ ] **Consolidated configuration appendix (sec.10)** - one-page reference of all config keys and defaults (`BlobStorage:*`, any `NotificationSummary:*`).

---

## 8. Migration & Backwards Compatibility

- **No breaking changes.** All new fields are optional/nullable on existing models.
- Existing `singleChoice` templates continue to work unchanged; `NotificationSummary` for them carries empty attachment/review-link lists and the existing title/context as the deliverable summary fallback.
- `CreateInstanceRequest` continues using the existing flat `Recipients` list. Role-based targeting will be added when Phase 14 (team registry) is implemented.
- `ResponseRecordV2` without `ApprovalDecision` is interpreted as a legacy single-choice response.
- `QuestionTemplate.Type` defaults to `"singleChoice"` for existing templates.
