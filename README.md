# dotbot

**Structured, auditable AI-assisted development for teams.**

## What is dotbot?

Most AI coding tools give you a result but no record of how you got there - no trail of decisions for teammates to follow, no way to continue work across sessions, and no framework for managing large projects.

dotbot wraps AI-assisted coding in a managed, transparent workflow where every step is tracked:

### Multi-workflow platform
- **Workflow-driven pipelines** - Define multi-step pipelines in `workflow.yaml` manifests with tasks, dependencies, form configuration, MCP servers, and environment requirements. A project can have multiple workflows installed simultaneously, each run, re-run, and stopped independently.
- **Typed task system** - Tasks can be `prompt` (AI-executed), `script` (PowerShell, no LLM), `mcp` (tool call), `task_gen` (generates sub-tasks dynamically), or `prompt_template` (AI with a workflow-specific prompt). Script, MCP, and task_gen tasks bypass the AI entirely - they auto-promote past analysis, skip worktree isolation, and skip verification hooks. This enables deterministic pipeline stages within AI-orchestrated workflows.
- **Enterprise registries** - Teams publish workflows, stacks, tools, and skills in git-hosted or local registries. `dotbot registry add` links a registry (private or public); `dotbot init -Workflow registry:name` installs from it. Registries are validated against a `registry.yaml` manifest with version compatibility checks and auth-failure hints for GitHub, Azure DevOps, and GitLab.
- **Workflows and stacks** - **Workflows** (e.g. `kickstart-via-jira`) define operational pipelines - what dotbot does. **Stacks** (e.g. `dotnet`, `dotnet-blazor`) add tech-specific skills, hooks, and MCP tools - what tech the project uses. Stacks compose additively with `extends` chains. Settings deep-merge across `default -> workflows -> stacks`.

### Execution engine
- **Two-phase execution** - Analysis resolves ambiguity, identifies files, and builds a context package. Implementation consumes that package and writes code. Tasks flow: `todo -> analysing -> analysed -> in-progress -> done`.
- **Per-task git worktree isolation** - Each task runs in its own worktree on an isolated branch, squash-merged back to main on completion.
- **Per-task model selection** - Tasks can specify a model (e.g. Sonnet for simple tasks, Opus for complex ones) that overrides the process-level default. Use cheaper models where they suffice to reduce token spend.
- **Multi-slot concurrent execution** - The workflow engine runs multiple tasks from the same workflow in parallel with slot-aware locking, shortening wall-clock time for large task queues.
- **Multi-provider** - Switch between **Claude**, **Codex**, and **Gemini** from the Settings tab. Each provider has its own CLI wrapper, stream parser, and model configuration.
- **Configurable permission modes** - Choose how each provider handles permission checks during autonomous execution. Claude supports bypass and auto mode (AI-classified safety); Codex supports bypass and full-auto; Gemini supports YOLO and auto-edit. The dashboard detects installed providers, their versions, and authentication status.

### Dashboard and observability
- **Web dashboard** - Seven-tab UI (Overview, Product, Roadmap, Processes, Decisions, Workflow, Settings) with workflow cards showing progress pills, per-workflow run/stop controls, and pipeline-phase filtering.
- **Manifest-driven kickstart** - The kickstart dialog is driven by `workflow.yaml` form modes with visibility flags for prompt, file upload, interview, and auto-workflow options.
- **JSONL audit trail** - Session logs capture token counts, costs, turn boundaries, wall-clock gaps, agent completion reasons, and error details. Every AI session, question, answer, and code change is version-controlled.
- **Project health diagnostics** - `dotbot doctor` scans for stale locks, orphaned worktrees, settings integrity, dependency issues, and task queue health.

### Collaboration and control
- **Operator steering** - Guide the AI mid-session through a heartbeat/whisper system. `/status` and `/verify` slash commands work during autonomous execution.
- **Kickstart interview** - Guided requirements-gathering flow that produces product documents, then generates a task roadmap automatically.
- **Human-in-the-loop Q&A** - When a task needs human input, dotbot routes questions to stakeholders via **Teams**, **Email**, or **Jira**.
- **Designed for teams** - The entire `.bot/` directory lives in your repo. Task queues, session histories, plans, and feedback are visible to everyone through git.

### Foundation
- **Zero-dependency tooling** - MCP server and web UI are pure PowerShell. No npm, pip, or Docker required. Cross-platform on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Security** - PathSanitizer strips absolute paths from AI output, privacy scan covers the full repo, and pre-commit hooks run gitleaks on staged files.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- **PowerShell 7+** - [Download](https://aka.ms/powershell)
- **Git** - [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **AI CLI** (at least one) - [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cli), [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

**Recommended MCP servers:**
- **[Playwright MCP](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/mcp-playwright)** - Browser automation for UI testing and verification.
- **[Context7 MCP](https://github.com/upstash/context7)** - Library documentation lookup to reduce hallucination.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dotbot globally (one-time)

```powershell
Install-Module Dotbot -Scope CurrentUser
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative install methods</strong></summary>

**One-liner:**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andresharpe/dotbot/main/install-remote.ps1 | iex
```

**Git clone:**
```powershell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/andresharpe/dotbot dotbot-install
cd dotbot-install
pwsh install.ps1
```

</details>

Restart your terminal so the `dotbot` command is available.

### 2. Add dotbot to your project

```powershell
cd your-project
dotbot init
```

This creates a `.bot/` directory with the MCP server, web UI, autonomous runtime, agents, skills, and workflows.

#### Workflows and Stacks

```powershell
dotbot init -Workflow kickstart-via-jira               # Install a workflow
dotbot init -Stack dotnet-blazor,dotnet-ef             # Install stacks
dotbot init -Workflow kickstart-via-jira -Stack dotnet  # Both
dotbot list                                            # List available workflows and stacks
```

- **Workflow** - Defines a multi-step pipeline with tasks, dependencies, scripts, and form configuration via `workflow.yaml`. A project can have multiple workflows installed. Each can be run and re-run independently (`dotbot run <name>`).
- **Stack** (composable) - Adds tech-specific skills, hooks, verify scripts, and MCP tools. Stacks can declare `extends` to auto-include a parent (e.g. `dotnet-blazor` extends `dotnet`).

Apply order: `default` -> workflows -> stacks (dependency-resolved). Settings are deep-merged; files are overlaid.

#### Enterprise Registries

Teams can publish workflows, stacks, tools, and skills in a git repo with a `registry.yaml` manifest:

```powershell
dotbot registry add myorg https://github.com/myorg/dotbot-extensions.git
dotbot registry add myorg C:\repos\myorg-dotbot-extensions  # Local path
dotbot registry update                                       # Update all registries
dotbot registry update myorg                                 # Update one registry
dotbot init -Workflow myorg:custom-workflow                  # Use from registry
```

### 3. Configure MCP Server

Add to your AI tool's MCP settings (Claude, Warp, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dotbot": {
      "command": "pwsh",
      "args": ["-NoProfile", "-File", ".bot/systems/mcp/dotbot-mcp.ps1"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start the UI

```powershell
.bot\go.ps1
```

Opens the web dashboard (default port 8686, auto-selects next available if busy).

## MCP Tools

The dotbot MCP server exposes 33 tools, auto-discovered from `systems/mcp/tools/`:

**Task Management** (15): `task_create`, `task_create_bulk`, `task_get_next`, `task_get_context`, `task_list`, `task_get_stats`, `task_mark_todo`, `task_mark_analysing`, `task_mark_analysed`, `task_mark_in_progress`, `task_mark_done`, `task_mark_needs_input`, `task_mark_skipped`, `task_answer_question`, `task_approve_split`

**Decision Tracking** (7): `decision_create`, `decision_get`, `decision_list`, `decision_update`, `decision_mark_accepted`, `decision_mark_deprecated`, `decision_mark_superseded`

**Session Management** (5): `session_initialize`, `session_get_state`, `session_get_stats`, `session_update`, `session_increment_completed`

**Plans** (3): `plan_create`, `plan_get`, `plan_update`

**Steering**: `steering_heartbeat`

**Development**: `dev_start`, `dev_stop`

Workflows and stacks can add their own tools (e.g. `kickstart-via-jira` adds `repo_clone`, `repo_list`, `atlassian_download`, `research_status`).

See `.bot/README.md` for full tool documentation.

## Testing

Four-layer test pyramid with ~500 assertions:

| Layer | What it covers | Credentials |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 - Structure | Syntax validation, module exports, workflow manifest parsing, task creation, condition evaluation, multi-workflow isolation | None |
| 2 - Components | MCP tool lifecycle, task types, decision tracking, provider CLI, notification client, workflow integration, UI server startup | None |
| 3 - Mock Provider | Analysis/execution flows with mock Claude CLI, rate limit detection, stream parsing | None |
| 4 - E2E | Full end-to-end with real AI provider API | API key |

```powershell
pwsh tests/Run-Tests.ps1            # Run layers 1-3
pwsh tests/Run-Tests.ps1 -Layer 1   # Structure tests
pwsh tests/Run-Tests.ps1 -Layer 2   # Component tests
pwsh tests/Run-Tests.ps1 -Layer 3   # Mock provider tests
pwsh tests/Run-Tests.ps1 -Layer 4   # E2E (requires API key)
```

CI runs layers 1-3 on every push and PR across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Layer 4 runs on schedule or manual trigger.

## Troubleshooting

**`dotbot` command not found after install** - Restart your terminal. The installer adds `~/dotbot/bin` to your PATH.

**Script execution blocked on Windows** - Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` and try again.

**PowerShell version error** - Requires PowerShell 7+. Check with `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` and [upgrade](https://aka.ms/powershell) if needed.
